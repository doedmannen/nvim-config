## My personal neovim configuration

Instead of trying to use zed or vscode with a vim plugin, why not go all the way?

This is a work in progress...

### Prerequisites

- Install the latest version of neovim (> v 0.11)
- Install support for lua rocks (maybe not needed...? I'm not using them now)
- Install ripgrep on your local system
